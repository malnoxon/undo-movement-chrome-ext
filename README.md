# undo-movement-chrome-ext
A chrome extension that lets you undo your most recent scrolling motion. This is useful if you accidentally hit the "Home" or "End" buttons on a long page and lose your location.

## Installation
There is no chrome web store installation for this (I don't feel like paying for a developer account)

To install you need to load this as an unpacked extension. You can find many instructions on how to do this,
one is at (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#manifest) starting with the navigation to chrome://extensions

## Use
Pressing `<Ctrl-Shift+K>` will scroll you back to wherever you were on the current page before the last time you scrolled.

(you can adjust the keybinding at chrome://extensions/shortcuts)
